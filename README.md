# Whac-A-Mole Game ðŸŽ¯

This project is a React-based Whac-A-Mole game originally built using Bolt.new prompts. Players gain points by clicking moles as they appear, while avoiding bombs and hitting golden moles for bonus power-ups. Each player starts with three lives and aims to achieve the highest possible score.

## Issues Encountered
- **Balancing spawn speed:** It was tricky to find a reasonable timing for moles to pop up. The AI logic sometimes made them appear too quickly or spam multiple moles
- **Feature scope vs. token limits:** With limited tokens, it was challenging to add as many features as I originally wanted to

## Time Spent
Approximately 2 hours of development

## Future Improvements
If given more tokens, I would add:
- New mole types with unique effects (e.g., freeze time, double points, shuffle holes)
- Difficulty scaling where mole speed and frequency increase gradually as levels progress
- Sound effects and background music for more immersive gameplay
- Leaderboard system for saving high scores

------------
Note: Since I ran out of tokens, I had to manually fix some things in order to get this project to work on netlify and to migrate changes to github :)
